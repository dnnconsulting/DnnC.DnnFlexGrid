# DnnC DnnFlexGrid

##Introduction
Recently I saw a Facebook post from Joe Brinkman about Flexbox which led me to creating this experimental responsive grid system. I also presented a demo of the grid system at the Dnn NL/BE community in Eindhoven on the 14th October 2016.
The idea is to show the how powerful flexbox is, therefore I decided to create a responsive grid.

##The goals of the experiment
The goals of this project are to show how easy it is to align content horizontally as well as vertically, to try and break away from the usual boundaries of the 12 column system systems that are used today in frameworks like Bootstrap which us floats.

There is a menus.ascx skin that shows what can be done with the combination of flexbox and the Dnn menu system.

## Warning : The Dnn Theme is a demo theme and shouldn't be used for production!


Enjoy!
